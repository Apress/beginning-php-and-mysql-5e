On **page 141** There are 2 errors on this page in the same line of code:
 
$carBrands = ["Cheverolet", "Chrysler""Ford", "Honda", "Toyota");

The first error is the closing parentheses ) instead it should be a bracket ] The second error is inside the array there is a missing comma between "Chrysler""Ford" it should be "Chrysler", "Ford".

The correct syntax for this array is:
$carBrands = ["Cheverolet", "Chrysler", "Ford", "Honda", "Toyota"]; ]
